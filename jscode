//Named funcion
function square(x){
  return x*x
}

result=square(3)
console.log(result)

//Anonymous:

//result_1 = square_1(3)
//console.log("Anonymous funcion result"+ result_1)
//Above commneted line will produce the error becuase java script does not know square_1 yet

square_1 = function(x){
  return x*x
}

result_1 = square_1(3)
console.log("Anonymous funcion result"+ result_1)

ES6-
let- it is blocked scope

for(let i=0;i<3;i++){

}
console.log(i); // produce an reference error as i is not available outside for block due to it is decalred with 'let' not 'var'

let i=0;
let i=2;

second declaration will give error.

const - If variable declared with const is object, we can change object content but we can not assign a new object to that variable

const customer = { name: 'ironman'}
customer = {} // error
customer['name'] = 'batman' // ok

const arr = [1,2]
arr = [5] // error
arr[0] = 4 // ok



string is immuatble data sctructure.
str = "hello world"
str[0] = "F" // no effect on str

objects don't store any data and it is mutable and it stores address of its content

Javascript is address based language
